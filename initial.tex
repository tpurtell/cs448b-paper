\section{Initial Designs}
 
After our initial interviews and developing the backend, we started to plan and develop our first prototypes. 
We choose to do this in parallel to hopefully get a more diverse set of visualizations. Ultimately we were 
left with three different prototypes, though two of which were similar enough to call them different versions 
of each other. In the next three sections we describe the explorer prototype and two versions of the entity
prototype.
