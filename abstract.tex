Newspaper archives are a treasure trove of historical information but their sheer volume presents problems for journalists and social scientists trying to understand macroscopic trends. In our work, we sought to address this problem. First, we interviewed a number of journalists and researchers to understand their workflow and the types of questions they are most interested in answering using news archives. Based on this feedback, we developed several prototypes to visualize these archives and iteratively improved our designs with further feedback. In this paper, we propose two different visualizations to help gain insight into these newspaper archives.
