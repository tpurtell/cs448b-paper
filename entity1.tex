The first iteration of the entity relation viewer was designed to allow the user to quickly navigate between terms and entities related to a base query. Similar to how a user of wikipedia will follow links between related articles and discover new material, users of the entity relation viewer can quickly jump from topic to topic in search of a hidden story buried in the data. This visualization was motivated by our interviews in which users expressed the desire to uncover unexpected relationships and trends in the data.

The viewer consists of a search box where a user can enter a search box, and a large sparkline plot at the bottom which shows the number of articles containing that term through time. About the large sparkline is a list of the top 15 related entities which co-occur in articles with the search term. In addition, each entity is accompanied by a small sparkline with a preview of that entity's trend over time to help the user pick out other interesting trends at a glance.

The second version of the entity relation viewer prototype was designed with many of the design decisions as the first version. Again quick exploration of related terms and a simple query  methodology were the heart of the design. This prototype does differ from the first version in one major way. In particular it allows frequency comparisons between different terms and assumes this will be at least as useful of an exploration method. As such it give people two way to explore terms; one for related terms and one for frequency comparisons.
