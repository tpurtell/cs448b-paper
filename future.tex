\section{Future}
Moving forward, we would like to continue user testing and gathering feedback on the two interfaces, with the goal of eventually distilling the most useful parts into one single tool. More normalization of the metadata (for instance, sections, authors, etc.) would also be beneficial, and would allow for the exposure of more term types in the interface. Finally, an obvious next step would be indexing the articles of more newspapers beyond the three that we have so far.
